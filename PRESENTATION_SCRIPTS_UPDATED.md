## 🎯 Presentation Tips

### For Individual Contributions (1 Minute Each)

**Timing Breakdown:**
- Introduction: 5 seconds ("Hi, I'm [Name], Index [Number], I built [X]")
- What you built: 20 seconds (backend and frontend)
- Technologies: 15 seconds (what you used and why)
- Demonstration: 20 seconds (show it working)
- Risks: 10 seconds (challenges and solutions)

**Tips:**
- **Practice with a timer** - 1 minute goes fast!
- **Speak clearly and confidently** - You built this!
- **Show your features** - Don't just talk, demonstrate
- **Be concise** - Hit the key points, skip details
- **Show enthusiasm** - Be proud of your work!

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Going over 1 minute - **Practice with timer!**  
❌ Reading from script robotically - **Speak naturally**  
❌ Not showing your features - **Demo is essential**  
❌ Too much technical jargon - **Keep it understandable**  
❌ Apologizing for your work - **Be confident!**  
❌ Forgetting to introduce yourself - **Name + Index first!**

### If Demo Breaks

- Stay calm and explain what *should* happen
- Show backup screenshots if available
- Explain the code instead
- Move on quickly - don't waste time troubleshooting
