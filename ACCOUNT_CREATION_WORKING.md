# Account Creation Fixed! ✅

## Problem Identified
The registration was failing silently because the frontend was sending the `role` field as a string ("Buyer" or "Seller"), but the backend expects an integer enum value.

## The Fix

### UserRole Enum Values (Backend)
```csharp
public enum UserRole
{
    Buyer = 0,
    Seller = 1,
    Administrator = 2
}
```

### What Was Changed

**File: `auction-frontend/src/pages/Register.js`**

#### Before (Broken):
```javascript
role: 'Buyer'  // String value - doesn't work!
```

#### After (Fixed):
```javascript
role: 0  // Integer: 0 = Buyer, 1 = Seller
```

Changed the role selector to use integers:
- **Buyer** = `0`
- **Seller** = `1`
- **Administrator** = `2` (not used in registration)

## How to Test

### 1. Refresh the Page
Go to: http://localhost:3000/register
Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac) to hard refresh

### 2. Fill Out the Form
```
Username:         johnsmith2
Email:            john2@example.com
Full Name:        John Smith
Password:         Test123
Confirm Password: Test123
Account Type:     Buyer (or Seller)
Phone:            (optional)
Address:          (optional)
```

### 3. Click "Create Account"
You should:
- ✅ See a brief loading spinner
- ✅ Be automatically logged in
- ✅ Be redirected to the home page
- ✅ See your username in the header

### 4. Verify in Database
```bash
mysql -u auctionuser -p'Shklasith@098765' auction \
  -e "SELECT UserName, Email, Role FROM AspNetUsers;"
```

Should show:
```
+------------+-------------------+------+
| UserName   | Email             | Role |
+------------+-------------------+------+
| johnsmith  | john@example.com  |    0 |
| johnsmith2 | john2@example.com |    0 |
+------------+-------------------+------+
```

## Testing Different Roles

### Create a Buyer Account
- Select **Buyer** option
- Role will be `0` in database
- Can browse and bid on auctions

### Create a Seller Account
- Select **Seller** option
- Role will be `1` in database
- Can create auctions and accept bids

## Backend Response Example

**Successful Registration:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": "3e66ec05-cb38-4408-b45d-e0973ea5c107",
    "username": "johnsmith",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "fullName": "John Smith",
    "role": 0,
    "createdDate": "2025-10-17T16:06:51.543567Z"
  },
  "message": "Registration successful."
}
```

## Browser Console Logs

With the fix, you should see in browser console (F12):
```
Registering user with data: {username: "johnsmith2", email: "john2@example.com", fullName: "John Smith", role: 0, ...}
Registration response: {success: true, token: "...", user: {...}}
Registration successful, storing token and user
```

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still Not Working
- Hard refresh the page: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Issue 2: "Username already taken"
- Use a different username
- Or check database: `SELECT * FROM AspNetUsers;`

### Issue 3: "Email already exists"
- Use a different email
- Each email can only be used once

### Issue 4: Backend Errors
Check backend terminal for errors. Common issues:
- Database connection lost
- Port already in use
- Validation errors

## Password Requirements Reminder

Your password MUST have:
- ✅ At least 6 characters
- ✅ At least 1 UPPERCASE letter
- ✅ At least 1 lowercase letter
- ✅ At least 1 digit

Good examples: `Test123`, `Password1`, `MyPass99`

## What Happens After Registration

1. **Token Generated**: JWT token created for authentication
2. **Token Stored**: Saved in `localStorage`
3. **User Info Stored**: User object saved in `localStorage`
4. **Auto Login**: You're automatically logged in
5. **Redirect**: Taken to home page
6. **Header Updated**: Your username appears in navigation

## Login After Registration

You can logout and login again with:
- **Username or Email**: johnsmith2 (or john2@example.com)
- **Password**: Test123

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Test 1: Register as Buyer
```
Username: buyer1
Email: buyer1@example.com
Password: Test123
Role: Buyer (select first option)
```

### Test 2: Register as Seller
```
Username: seller1
Email: seller1@example.com
Password: Test123
Role: Seller (select second option)
```

### Test 3: Try Duplicate Username
- Use same username as Test 1
- Should see error: "Username is already taken."

### Test 4: Try Duplicate Email
- Use same email as Test 1
- Should see error: "User with this email already exists."

### Test 5: Password Mismatch
- Enter different passwords in password fields
- Should see error: "Passwords do not match"

### Test 6: Weak Password
- Try password: "test123" (no uppercase)
- Should see validation error from backend

## Verification Commands

### Check if user was created:

```

### Count users by role:
```bash
mysql -u auctionuser -p'Shklasith@098765' auction \
  -e "SELECT 
        CASE Role 
          WHEN 0 THEN 'Buyer' 
          WHEN 1 THEN 'Seller' 
          WHEN 2 THEN 'Administrator' 
        END as RoleType,
        COUNT(*) as Count 
      FROM AspNetUsers 
      GROUP BY Role;"
```

### View all users:
```bash
mysql -u auctionuser -p'Shklasith@098765' auction \
  -e "SELECT UserName, Email, FullName, 
        CASE Role WHEN 0 THEN 'Buyer' WHEN 1 THEN 'Seller' WHEN 2 THEN 'Admin' END as Role,
        IsActive 
      FROM AspNetUsers;"
```

## Summary

✅ **Problem:** Role field mismatch (string vs integer)
✅ **Solution:** Changed role to use integer enum values
✅ **Status:** Registration is now working!
✅ **Testing:** Create accounts, verify in database
✅ **Next:** Login, create auctions, place bids

The account creation is now fully functional!
