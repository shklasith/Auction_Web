# Authentication Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Backend
```bash
cd Auction_Web
dotnet run
```
The backend should be running on `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 2: Start the Frontend
```bash
cd auction-frontend
npm install  # if not already installed
npm start
```
The frontend will open at `http://localhost:3000`

```

### For Production:
Update the `.env` file with your production API URL:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-domain.com/api
```

## üìù Code Examples

### Using Authentication in Components:
```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../context/AuthContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, isSeller, logout } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isAuthenticated() ? (
        <>
          <h1>Welcome, {user.fullName}!</h1>
          {isSeller() && <button>Create Auction</button>}
          <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <Link to="/login">Please Login</Link>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Creating a Protected Route:
```javascript
<Route 
  path="/my-page" 
  element={
    <PrivateRoute requiredRole="Seller">
      <MyPage />
    </PrivateRoute>
  } 
/>
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't login
**Check:**
- Is the backend running?
- Is the API URL correct in `.env`?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user credentials are correct

### Issue: 404 on API calls
**Solution:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `.env`

### Issue: Token expired
**Solution:**
- Logout and login again
- Token is automatically refreshed on app load

### Issue: Can't upload profile image
**Solution:**
- Check backend ImageService configuration
- Verify `wwwroot/images/profiles` folder exists
- Check file size and format (should be image files)
