# Quick Fix Summary: "Failed to create auction" Error

## âœ… FIXED

### Problem
Users couldn't create auctions - getting "Failed to create auction" error.

### Root Cause
Frontend was sending auction type as **string** ("Standard") instead of **integer** (0).

### Solution Applied
Changed `auction-frontend/src/pages/CreateAuction.js` to send integer enum values:
- Standard Auction = 0
- Reserve Auction = 1
- Buy It Now = 2
- Dutch Auction = 3

### What Was Changed
1. Auction type dropdown values changed from strings to integers (line 57)
2. Initial form state changed from `type: 'Standard'` to `type: 0` (line 21)
3. Added parseInt conversion in form handler (line 110-112)
4. Added explicit type conversion in submit handler (line 222)

### Testing Results
âœ… All 4 auction types tested successfully
âœ… API accepts integer values correctly
âœ… Production build updated

### To Use the Fix
If the frontend is already running, restart it:
```bash
cd auction-frontend
npm start
```

Or if using the built version, it's already updated in the `build/` folder.
