## 🚀 How to Access Admin Features

### 1. **Create an Admin User**
First, you need to create an admin user in your database or use the registration endpoint with Administrator role.

```sql
-- Update an existing user to admin role
UPDATE AspNetUsers 
SET Role = 2  -- 2 = Administrator
WHERE Email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

Or via API (you'll need to implement this endpoint or use existing registration):
```javascript
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "username": "admin",
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "fullName": "Admin User",
  "password": "Admin@123",
  "confirmPassword": "Admin@123",
  "role": 2  // Administrator
}
```

### 2. **Login as Admin**
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Login with your admin credentials
- Click on your profile dropdown in the header
- Click on "Admin Panel" to access the dashboard

### 3. **Access Points**
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard`
- **Profile**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/profile`
